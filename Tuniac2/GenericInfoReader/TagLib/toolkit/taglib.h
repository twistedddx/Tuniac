 * \mainpage TagLib
 * \section intro Introduction
 * TagLib, is well, a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly know as \e tags.
 *
 * Some goals of TagLib:
 * - A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
 * - Support for at least ID3v1, ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis \e comments.
 * - A generic, \e simple API for the most common tagging related functions.
 * - Binary compatibility between minor releases using the standard KDE/Qt techniques for C++ binary compatibility.
 * - Make the tagging framework extensible by library users; i.e. it will be possible for libarary users to implement
 *   additional ID3v2 frames, without modifying the TagLib source (through the use of <i>Abstract Factories</i> and
 *   such.
 *
 * Because TagLib desires to be toolkit agnostic, in hope of being widely adopted and the most flexible in licensing
 * TagLib provides many of its own toolkit classes; in fact the only external dependancy that TagLib has, it a
 * semi-sane STL implementation.
 *
 * \section why Why TagLib?
 *
 * TagLib was written to fill a gap in the Open Source/Free Software community.  Currently there is a lack in the
 * OSS/FS for a homogenous API to the most common music types.
 *
 * As TagLib will be initially injected into the KDE community, while I am not linking to any of the KDE or Qt libraries
 * I have tried to follow the coding style of those libraries.  Again, this is in sharp contrast to id3lib, which
 * basically provides a hybrid C/C++ API and uses a dubious object model.
 *
 * I get asked rather frequently why I am replacing id3lib (mostly by people that have never worked with id3lib), if
 * you are concerned about this please email me; I can provide my lengthy standard rant.  :-)
 *
 * \section examples Examples:
 *
 * I've talked a lot about the \e homogenous API to common music formats.  Here's an example of how things (will) work:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * TagLib::FileRef f("Latex Solar Beef.mp3");
 * TagLib::String artist = f.tag()->artist(); // artist == "Frank Zappa"
 *
 * f.tag()->setAlbum("Fillmore East");
 * f.save();
 *
 * TagLib::FileRef g("Free City Rhymes.ogg");
 * TagLib::String album = g.tag()->album(); // album == "NYC Ghosts & Flowers"
 *
 * g.tag()->setTrack(1);
 * g.save();
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that these high level functions work for Ogg, FLAC, MPC \e and MP3 (or any other formats supported in the
 * future).  For this high level API, which is suitable for most applications, the differences between tag and file
 * formats can all be ignored.
 *
 * \section Building
 *
 * TagLib provides a script called taglib-config that returns the necessary compiler and linker flags, as well as the
 * version number.  To build a small sample program one would use:
 *
 * <tt>g++ taglib-test.cpp `taglib-config --cflags --libs` -o taglib-test</tt>
 *
 * This should generally be integrated into the configure check for TagLib in your project.
 *
 * \note TagLib includes assume that you have the TagLib include path specified in the compile line, by default
 * <tt>-I/usr/local/include/taglib</tt>.  Using <tt>#include <taglib/tag.h></tt> <b>will not work</b>.  (Though this
 * is usually handled by the taglib-config script mentioned above.)
