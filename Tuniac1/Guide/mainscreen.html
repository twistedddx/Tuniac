				<h2>What does what do?</h2>
				<h3>Main screen</h3>
				<p><img src="Images/MainScreen.jpg" alt=""/></p>
				<h3><a id="Anchor-msmo"></a>1. Menu options</h3>
				<p>In the menu options you can do all the things you want to do with respect to Tuniac. You can import files, control the player, change your preferences and much, much more. What exactly is possible in these menu's you can find on the <a href="menu.html">Menu options</a> page.</p>
				<h3><a id="Anchor-mssi"></a>2. Song info</h3>
				<p>This part of Tuniac shows the currently playing song and the performing artist of the song that is playing.</p>
				<h3><a id="Anchor-mspc"></a>3. Play controls</h3>
				<p>Here you can simply control the player, you can start and pause the player from here and go to the next or previous song. You can also control the player with shortcuts which are listed on the <a href="shortcuts.html">Shortcuts</a> page. You can also control the player with command line options which can be found on the <a href="commandline.html">Commandline options</a> page. On right clicking the next button you can access the <a href="glossary.html#Anchor_glfl">future list</a>. On right clicking the previous button you can access the <a href="glossary.html#Anchor_glhl">history list</a> and choose a song in it. If you use ctrl while clicking the previous button, it won't go back one song in the playlist, but one song in <a href="glossary.html#Anchor_glhl">history list</a>.</p>
				<h3><a id="Anchor-mspb"></a>4. Progress bar</h3>
				<p>On the left of the progressbar you can find the time of the song that has already been played. This time is shown in the progressbar as a black rectangle.

				<h3><a id="Anchor-mssb"></a>5. Search bar</h3>
				<p>In the search bar you can search for a particular song by giving a keyword of what your looking for. The result can be put in a separate playlist with the small arrow that appears on the left of the bar on typing in a keyword. With the x button that appears on the left you can discard the search results. The question mark on the right, you can use to search by fields. This way you can for example search in the genre, without searching in titles and so on. You can also enable the <a href="glossary.html#Anchor-glrf">reverse filter</a> while searching here.</p>
				<h3><a id="Anchor-mssr"></a>6. Source</h3>
				<p>In this part of Tuniac the playlists you've created and the media library are shown. It is possible to delete or rename a playlist by clicking on a playlist logo and using the right button on the mouse. This way you can also start playing a certain playlist that you've created. On selecting a certain playlist or the media library the songs in it are displayed in the right window. You can change the  playlist order by left clicking and dragging them to a new position. This can not be done with the media library. </p>
