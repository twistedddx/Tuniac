BASIC NEW IDEAS:
================

- preferences on what to do for single/double/right/middle click of tray icon
	like the way QCD handles it
	eg, play/pause, next, prev, bring to front, hide/show

- automatically generating playlists based on a set of rules. 
	ie, create a playlist for each artist, each genre, or each album of a certain artist
	option to keep to remove existing playlists 
	naming of playlists can use current window title code, but have presets generated on above options

- preference to save current song and play state on exit
	ie, let user decide if they want to keep playing again when they start tuniac again

- different right-click menus for playlist types
	generated on the fly, or just a resource?

- new playlist type - favourites
	automatically generated from top 5% of most played/rated songs in entire media library

- hotkeys need an interface in preference



#####################
# SONG RATING FIELD #
#####################

concept
=======

- each song in the media library will have a new (intelligent) rating field (not at the playlist level)

- each time a song is played, its rating is increased. this is weighted, depending on current rating value
	eg, for high rated songs, increase y small amount; for low rated songs, increase by comparitively larger amount
	could increase by 1/rating ?

- user can manually rate a song, which will increase/decrease its ratio by 2/rating (or something more than the increase of merely playing it)
	
- 2 buttons: like/dislike
	between next button and song details pane?
	on popup new song notification, if enabled
	option for global hotkey


implementation
==============

- refresh after a change of rating reaches the lower-bound rating of the existing favourites list

- on change of a rating:
	
	if song is in favs and is now lowest rated, find highest rated below new lower-bound if song were removed - replace if nessisary
	if song is not in favs, and rating is above the lower bound rating of existing favs, replace lowest rated in favs with current song

	decrease rating of all other songs by change/sqrt(n)



##############################
# PLAY PREFERED SHUFFLE TYPE #
##############################

NOTE: depends on rating system


concept
=======

- similar to normal shuffle mode, except favourite songs are more likely to play

- favourite songs are ones played most often. the list is limited in size to a certain percentage of the playtlist, as defined by the user




options
=======

- percentage of songs to concider "prefered"
	default 5% of playlist size

- percent chance to select from prefered list over entire list
	default 40% more-likely chance
	ie, prefered songs will have a (100/n + p%/pn)% chance to play (also has chance to play in normal list), as opposed to 100/n% chance of normal songs

menu
====

shuffle ->	disabled (default)
			normal shuffle
			play prefered



implementation
==============

- generation of favourites list (on both media library and playlist level?) will need to be done as quickly as possible, as it may need to be refreshed regularly
