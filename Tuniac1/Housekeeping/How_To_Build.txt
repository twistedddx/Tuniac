How to build Tuniac:


This is written with Visual Studio Community 2026 in mind in January 2026.
Things may have changed since, use this only as a guide.

For me:

Tuniac 1 svn is in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1
libjpeg-turbo svn is in D:\Code\libjpeg-turbo
zlib git is in D:\Code\zlib
Taglib git is in D:\Code\taglib
You can put things where you like, you just need to adjust your folder paths accordingly.

I *strongly* recommend creating the repositories as listed in a single folder.
Eg you can have E:\monkey\libjpeg-turbo but you also should have E:\monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1 etc
Keep spaces out of the folder paths also. Eg dont use E:\purple monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1



1)First install Visual Studio 2022.



2)You require TortoiseGIT and CMake or equals

https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download

https://cmake.org/
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v4.2.3/cmake-4.2.3-windows-x86_64.msi

Install them



3)Gather repositories

3a)You need Tuniac 1.0 git (https://tuni.ac/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/twistedddx/Tuniac.git
Hit OK and wait

3b)You need TagLib 2.0.0 GIT (https://taglib.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/taglib/taglib
Hit OK and wait

3c)You need libspng 0.7.4 GIT (https://libspng.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/randy408/libspng.git
Hit OK and wait

3d)You need libjpeg-turbo 3.1.0 GIT (https://libjpeg-turbo.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo
Hit OK and wait

3e)You need xbmc goom:
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/xbmc/visualization.goom/
Hit OK and wait

3f)You need SimpleWebP:
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/MikuAuahDark/simplewebp.git
Hit OK and wait



4)Build dependencies (turbojpeglib, libspng, taglib/zlib)

You should have NASM
https://www.nasm.us/

Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_vcpkg.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_libspng.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_turbojpeglib.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_taglib.cmd

These cmd assume Win11 x64 and Visual Studio 2022 if you have anything else you may need to mod the file.


5)For the 32bit Sonique Visual Plugin visual (SVP_Plugin)

Note that 64 bit build works but there is no 64 bit SVP plugins to load.
If you compile the solution this is skipped.

5a)TuniacGoomVisualPlugin needs glew libs. Put them in TuniacGoomVisualPlugin\lib\Release\Win32 and x64
Download https://github.com/nigels-com/glew
https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases/tag/glew-2.2.0

6)For TuniacApp

6a)Build libjpeg-turbo static lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'jpeglib.h'

6b)Build libspng static lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'spng.h'

7)std_Infomanager, build taglib static lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'tag.h'



8)To build installer from scripts

You need Inno QuickStart Pack
https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

8a)https://files.jrsoftware.org/is/6/innosetup-6.7.0.exe
Install everything it offers in the installer.

Install Inno Download Plugin
https://mitrichsoftware.wordpress.com/inno-setup-tools/inno-download-plugin/

Make sure to check "Add IDP include path to ISPPBuiltins.iss" option during IDP installation.
This will add:
; Inno Download Plugin include path
#pragma include __INCLUDE__ + ";" + ReadReg(HKLM, "Software\Mitrich Software\Inno Download Plugin", "InstallDir")

If it doesn't add the above, add it to the end of C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISPPBuiltins.iss

Goto D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Setup-Scripts
Right click desired setup iss file
Select Compile
New date named exe should be in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\
