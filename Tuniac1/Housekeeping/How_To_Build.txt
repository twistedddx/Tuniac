How to build Tuniac:


This is written with Visual Studio 2010 in mind in March 2012.
Things may have changed since, use this only as a guide.

For me:

Tuniac 1 svn is in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1
libjpeg-turbo svn is in D:\Code\libjpeg-turbo
zlib git is in D:\Code\zlib
Taglib git is in D:\Code\taglib
You can put things where you like, you just need to adjust your folder paths accordingly.

I *strongly* recommend creating the repositories as listed in a single folder.
Eg you can have E:\monkey\libjpeg-turbo but you also should have E:\monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1 etc
Keep spaces out of the folder paths also. Eg dont use E:\purple monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1



1)First install Visual Studio 2010.
During the installer remember to also instill the 64bit compiler.

1a)You should update your Platform SDK if needed.

Platform SDK 7.1:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=6b6c21d2-2006-4afa-9702-529fa782d63b

1b)If you have Visual Studio 2010 Express you will need the Windows Platform SDK as it's not included.
Dot point 2 of the below link may also need to be done for Express.

Look here for errors that look like:
cannot open include file 'winresrc.h'



2)You require TortoiseSVN, TortoiseGIT and CMake or equals

http://tortoisesvn.net/
http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html

http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list

http://www.cmake.org/
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.7-win32-x86.exe

Install them



3)Gather repositories

3a)You need Tuniac SVN (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuniac/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select SVN Checkout.
In URL of repository add:
https://tuniac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tuniac
Hit OK and wait

3b)You need libjpeg-turbo SVN (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select SVN Checkout.
In URL of repository add:
https://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libjpeg-turbo
Hit OK and wait

3d)You should get zlib GIT (http://zlib.net/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/madler/zlib
Hit OK and wait

3d)You need TagLib GIT (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/taglib/taglib
Hit OK and wait



4)Build dependencies (turbojpeglib, taglib/zlib)

Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_turbojpeglib.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_taglib.cmd
This cmd assumes Win7 x64 and Visual Studio 2010 if you have anything else you will need to mod the file.
You can also get all the build recipes for individual building of libs in there.



5)For the 32bit Sonique Visual Plugin visual (SVP_Plugin)

You need the Glew 1.7.0 Binaries Windows 32-bit zip.
http://glew.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.7.0/glew-1.7.0-win32.zip/download

Put glew.h, glxew.h and wglew.h in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\GL
And put glew32.lib and glew32s.lib in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'GL/glew.h'



6)For TuniacApp

6a)You need the current DirectX June 2010 SDK for XAudio2.
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'xaudio2.h'


6b)Build libjpeg-turbo static lib

You can use my files if you cant get it to build right:
http://www.wasteofcash.com/Tuniac/libjpeg-turbo_1.2.0_vs2010.zip
extract to D:\Code\libjpeg-turbo\trunk

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'jpeglib.h'



7)std_Infomanager, build taglib static lib

You can use my project if you cant get it to build right:
http://www.wasteofcash.com/Tuniac/zlib_1.2.6_vs2010.zip
extract to D:\Code\taglib\zlib

http://www.wasteofcash.com/Tuniac/taglib_1.7_vs2010.zip
extract to D:\Code\taglib\taglib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'tag.h'



8)To build installer from scripts

You need Inno QuickStart Pack
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/ispack.exe

Install everything it offers in the installer.

I find it easiest to then install the standard Inno Setup installer over the top of that
http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe

This adds the right click context "Compile" for *.iss files

Goto D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Setup-Scripts
Right click desired setup iss file
Select Compile
New date named exe should be in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\
