How to build Tuniac:


This is written with Visual Studio Community 2022 in mind in January 2024.
Things may have changed since, use this only as a guide.

For me:

Tuniac 1 svn is in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1
libjpeg-turbo svn is in D:\Code\libjpeg-turbo
zlib git is in D:\Code\zlib
Taglib git is in D:\Code\taglib
You can put things where you like, you just need to adjust your folder paths accordingly.

I *strongly* recommend creating the repositories as listed in a single folder.
Eg you can have E:\monkey\libjpeg-turbo but you also should have E:\monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1 etc
Keep spaces out of the folder paths also. Eg dont use E:\purple monkey\tuniac\Tuniac1



1)First install Visual Studio 2022.



2)You require TortoiseGIT and CMake or equals

https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download

https://cmake.org/
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.1/cmake-3.28.1-windows-x86_64.msi

Install them



3)Gather repositories

3a)You need Tuniac 1.0 git (https://tuni.ac/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/twistedddx/Tuniac.git
Hit OK and wait

3b)You need TagLib 2.0.0 GIT (https://taglib.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/taglib/taglib
Hit OK and wait

3c)You need libspng 0.7.4 GIT (https://libspng.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/randy408/libspng.git
Hit OK and wait

3d)You need libjpeg-turbo 3.0.1 GIT (https://libjpeg-turbo.org/)
Navigate to C:\Code\, right click empty space and select GIT Clone.
In Clone existing repository add:
https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo
Hit OK and wait




4)Build dependencies (turbojpeglib, libspng, taglib/zlib)

Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_vcpkg.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_libspng.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_turbojpeglib.cmd
Run D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Housekeeping\build_taglib.cmd

These cmd assume Win11 x64 and Visual Studio 2022 if you have anything else you may need to mod the file.


5)For the 32bit Sonique Visual Plugin visual (SVP_Plugin)

Note that 64 bit build works but there is no 64 bit SVP plugins to load.
If you compile the solution this is skipped.



6)For TuniacApp

6a)Build libjpeg-turbo static lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'jpeglib.h'

6b)Build libspng static lib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'spng.h'

7)std_Infomanager, build taglib static lib

https://tuni.ac/extra/VS2022/taglib_1120_vs2022.zip
extract to D:\Code\taglib\taglib

Look here for errors that look like:
Cannot open include file: 'tag.h'



8)To build installer from scripts

You need Inno QuickStart Pack
https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

8a)http://files.jrsoftware.org/ispack/innosetup-qsp-5.6.1.exe
8b)http://files.jrsoftware.org/is/5/innosetup-5.6.1-unicode.exe
Install everything it offers in the installers.
I find it easiest to then install the standard Inno Setup installer over the top of qsp
This adds the right click context "Compile" for *.iss files

Install Inno Download Plugin
https://mitrichsoftware.wordpress.com/inno-setup-tools/inno-download-plugin/

Make sure to check "Add IDP include path to ISPPBuiltins.iss" option during IDP installation.


Goto D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\Setup-Scripts
Right click desired setup iss file
Select Compile
New date named exe should be in D:\Code\tuniac\Tuniac1\
