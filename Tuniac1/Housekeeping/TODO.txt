Playlist/Media library
======================

- document import/export interfaces
	and do plugin for xpl (xml) playlists

- implement ID_FILE_NEWPLAYLIST_SMARTPLAYLIST
	basically a filter preset for the entire media library

- should be able to select files right click and do "update" - to refresh via info manager

- skip streams in normal play order - since they never end
	make so they can only be played by having the user manually select them


Misc
====

- edit track info dialog - change dialog title, file data from track (doesn't show anything atm), disable on empty playlist. see EditTrackInfo() in PlaylistSourceView.cpp

- volume control should have preference for what volume it changes (system/wave out/tuniac)

- new icons for filetypes:

	not bundled with dlls
	in own directory, so user can replace them
	format: /icons/tuniac.ogg.ico etc
	- can't be done easily? iconhander dlls are a bitch

- preferences for what clicking on trayicon should do (eg, single click: play/pause, or show window)

- sorting by play count isn't implemented. needs to be fixed so that other on-the-fly generated fields not related to the LibraryEntry itself can be sorted by

Audio Chain / Plugins
=====================

- add dsp plugin interface?

- WAV input/output?

- document plugin interface for a basic SDK

- add option for volume control to modify system/wave out/tuniac levels

- code in stream-specific volume settings

	will allow for tuniac-level volume control, and replay-gain later on

- streaming - its fucked?

	can't quit while openning a stream (gets stuck in creating the source, which makes its onn thread, before Tuniac knows - so can't exit thread)
	pausing and resuming - get timeshifting? nice "feature"/undocumented creature
	needs to do something with the metadata
	reset current playtime when metadata changes to a new song?


General Plugins
===============

- Generic interface to save plugin configs - save as stream?

	All plugins need this
	Needs to pass through Tuniac rather than let the plugin handle it (incase -dontsaveprefs is set)

- Per-plugin config stuff (eg, to toggle extended mode for export plugins)

	Only import/export plugins need this added?



Visuals
=======

- document visual plugin interface

- code sample visual. skeleton there, make it do something

<vaguely> can you make it double click to exit fullscreen


CD Audio
========

-crossfade flag


Localization
============

- design basic structure for XML based anguage files

- seperate language class - should work like s2
